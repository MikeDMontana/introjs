Introduction to JavaScript Exercises

These are test driven development oriented exercises from the
Introduction to JavaScript and Web Development two day class
offered by Montana Code School.

The first is from the Fizz Buzz drinking game, where multiples
of 3 are converted to 'Fizz', multiples of 5 to 'Buzz', and multiples
of 3 and 5 are converted to 'FizzBuzz'. You need to add to the implementation
in fizzBuzz.js. And change the "xit" tests to "it" to activate them in
fizzBuzzTest.js

The second is a converter of Roman Numerals into regular JavaScript
integers. You need to add to the implementation in romanNumeralConverter.js,
change the "xit" tests to "it" to activate them in romanNumeralConverterTest.js.
You can add more tests for more roman number examples.

To start, you need to install Node.js
Then run 'npm install' in the project root directory to get mocha and chai.

Both tests should be run with 'npm test'.
